  <p>The Adhdeveloper's tech journey started when he was a young boy that was told by his mother, "you can't get a job playing videogames all day."[1] and realized she was probably right and he should figure out what to do with his life, the reasoning went "I like computer games, they run on computers, people have jobs working with computers. I'll try doing computers." thus was born a lifelong fascination, and a career of <s>legendary</s>, <s>stellar</s>, <s>accetpable</s>[2] success. Since then he's worked in mutliple tech fields as an identity engineer, a full stack developer[3], cloud and devops[4] engineer before finally ending up in security and realizing that was the only field that had enough different aspects to appease his constant ADHD tendancy of constantly needing something new, security also had the added benefit of having a near-endless stream of certs associated with it to satisfy his magpie like urges of collecting pieces of paper with fancy lettering.</p>
  <p>When he's not fearlessly discovering new breakthroughs to advanced the frontiers of human understanding or engineering new and brilliant technical solutions[5] the adhdeveloper likes to spend time with his wife and children, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, go hiking, play D&D, read Brandon Sanderson, and pick up new skills, currenlty it's learning Russian.</p>

  <h2>Footnotes</h3>
  [1] This was in the days before Twitch and esports and what not, it was a common line repeated at the time.
  [2] By acceptable we mean that he hasn't starved to death yet.
  [3] I mean real full stack developer not "I spent six weeks at a boot camp and now can desecrate the backend with the genital herpes that is JavaScript and know MongoDB." I did multliple languages, including raw SQL when needed and worked with the frontend as well, and setup the networking and everything else associated with applications, not just threw up a MEAN stack and called it a day.
  [4] Everytime someone says DevSecOps an angel puppy gets kicked.
  [5] Read: screaming profanity filled rants as poorly documneted technology that refuses to work like he wants it to.
  [6] Especially the PHBs.
  [7] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V20WkApl6A" alt="Good song">Really my mom earned it but they gave the badge to me.</a>
