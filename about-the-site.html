  <h2>About the Site</h2>
  <h3>Why does your site look like it was created during the Roosevelt administration (Teddy not Franklin)?</h3>
  <p>The design for this website was inspired almost entirely by <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/</a>. The arguments for this design are laid out very clearly and explicitly at the aforementioned site.</p>
  <p>It also so happens that designing and running the site in this manner makes development super easy, I can do it from anywhere, my phone, my laptop, a hotel room TV, hell I could probably maintain this site in Morse code without too much effort. It is beautiful simple and easy to maintain and support.</p>
  <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>
  <p>This site exists to give me a platform to loose my inane ramblings on the vast world wide web, which transforms me from some random yahoo to a random yahoo that has a blog and thus sound more authoritative when arguing beacuse I have my intellectual excrement spewed on a domain I own.</p>
  <p>Beyond that I spend a bunch of time researching things and figuring crap out and the best way to 1) gain understanding and 2) remember things learned is to explain what you've learned to someone else. Unfortunately most normal people in my life have as much desire to have things like the intricacies of the Kerberos protocols, or an indepth explination of how Nginx handles request buffers, taught to them as they have desire to have a root canal without ansthesia. On the internet though I can pretended I have vast armies of intellectual peers that are sagely nodding and muttering to themselves "yes, yes" while stroking their beards, and sitting in awestruck admiration of my deep penetrating insights, which is far more motivating than trying to explain it to my wife's stuffed Doomslug.</p>
  <h3>What does this site focus on?</h3>
  <p>Given the name of the website, I think the term "focus" is a bit of a stretch but it generally deals with tech related topics, as well as engineering life, and sometimes strays into the business side of discussion as well. Despite the name of the site a lot of the focus will be on security related topics as that's what I do professionally right now. In reality it mostly ends up being a brain dump of information for whatever certification I am working towards or product I am working on.</p>
